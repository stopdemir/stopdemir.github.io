## Works & Projects

### [Master Thesis](https://research.sabanciuniv.edu/id/eprint/36870/)
- A Mathematical Model and Application on Prevention of Gerrymandering
- Developed an analytical approaches in order to show the detrimental effects of a malpractise named gerrymandering
- Several technologies have been used such as CPLEX Java API, R, QGIS.
- A Mixed-Integer Mathematical Model developed and solved optimally for relatively small cases
- A Tabu search algorithm has been employed for relatively large cases
- [codebase](https://github.com/stopdemir/Tabu-Search-Implementation)
